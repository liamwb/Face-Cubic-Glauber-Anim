# Face-Cubic-Glauber-Anim

This repository implements a visual simulation of the face-cubic Glauber process, on the complete graph and the square lattice.

## Description

This project was made for use in talks to help explain the face-cubic Glauber process. It allows the user to play with both of the parameters of the model ($d$ and $\beta$), and see the effect that changing these parameters has on the behaviour of the model.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3
* Numpy, Matplotlib

### Installing

Run the Python script `main.py` in your favourite way. There is a `shell.nix` if you want to use `nix-shell` or `nix develop`, but you certainly don't have to.

This project was inspired by a [simulation of the liquid-vapor model](https://vilas.us/simulations/liquidvapor/), which you can learn more about in the following excellent videos:
